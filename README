Imagine, one day, your house gets robbed. You have several very expensive things in
your home that were stolen, but you have no way to prove that. The police will take a 
list from you, but the insurer will only pay you a fraction of what was actually lost 
because they can’t verify that everything you said you owned was actually yours. 
PropertyCoin will change that. We want to build an app that will essentially store 
everything that you own. If you want to get insurance on everything, you can show your insurer 
the chain which shows what you own. If you want to get insurance on certain things, you 
can make a separate ledger, transfer the PropertyCoin it, and then send that to the insurer 
(so that the insurer doesn’t know everything that you own) This way, the insurer is protected in 
that you can not make false claims about ownership, and the owner of the goods is protected in that 
all of things they want insured will actually get reimbursed if they get stolen.
